# System Management Tool (Bash)
--------------------------------

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This tool was created for a project in my class COS350 - Systems Programming at University of Southern Maine.
The purpose is to provide diagnostics and functionality for management of the system.

This project was the final portion of learning the shell language bash.

<h2>Functionality</h2>

All of the commands for the script, along with the usage of the commands can be found on the help page.

This page can be seen by just using the script with no arguments or when '-help' is entered as the argument.

Whenever a command is executed, the log file is updated with the current date/time, the user and the command used with the script.
